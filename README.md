# Defense demo on AEs generated by JSMA attack

After processing 1,000 AEs using our inpainting-based-defense, we obtain 1,000 resulting images (see Dropbox [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w6r2cetl4pxreoz/AADXG8NZ492raZFb5Kx_QOIqa?dl=0)
). You can go through the script eval_inpaint_on_jsma_test.py to test it.
